1. Install the OpenSKOS code
===============================================================================
Copy the code to a location of your choise. Make sure all files are readable by
your webserver. Make sure the "data/uploads" directory is writable for the webserver.
For security reasons you can place this "data" directory outside your
webserver's document root.

1.1 Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To configure OpenSKOS you have to rename:
  APPROOT/application/configs/application.ini.dist
to
  APPROOT/application/configs/application.ini

Now you van edit the APPROOT/application/configs/application.ini
You can have separate config settings for specific deployments. The 
configuration section marked by the Environment Variable "APPLICATION_ENV" (see
3.1 Setting Up Your VHOST). Most settings are self explanatory.

1.1.1 OAI-PMH setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OpenSKOS includes a OAI harvester. To configure OAI Service providers, use the
"instances" part of the configuration. Two types of instances are supported:
- openskos (instances of OpenSKOS)
- external (any OAI-PMH provider that provides SKOS/XML-RDF data)

The setup for "openskos" types is easy:
instances.openskos.type=openskos
instances.openskos.url=http://HOSTNAME
instances.openskos.label=YOUR LABEL

For "external" types use this syntax: 
instances.example1.type=external
instances.example1.url=http://HOSTNAME
instances.example1.label=EXAMPLE LABEL
#optional, default=oai_rdf
instances.example1.metadataPrefix=METADATAPREFIX
#optional:
instances.example1.set=SETSPEC

You can define multiple instances by using a different key (in the above example
the key "example1" is used").


2. Zend Framework
===============================================================================
Download a 1.11 branch from http://framework.zend.com/ and make sure it is in 
you php include path. You can do this by setting the "include_path" directive
in your php.ini. 

3. Webserver with PHP support
===============================================================================
You can install your favorite webserver with PHP support.
All development and testing was done using Apache/2.2.15 with PHP 5.3.8
Make sure your PHP installation supports at least one supported Database
adapters (see http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.adapter.html)

3.1 Setting Up Your VHOST
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is a sample VHOST you might want to consider for your project.

<VirtualHost *:80>
   DocumentRoot "/PATH/TO/CODE/public"
   ServerName YOUR.SERVER.NAME

   # This should be omitted in the production environment
   SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development
    
   <Directory "/PATH/TO/CODE/public">
       Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride All
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
   </Directory>
    
</VirtualHost>


4. Database setup
===============================================================================
Install your choise of Zend Framework supported Database engine (see
http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.adapter.html). The credentials to
access your database can be configured in the application's configuration. 

5. Apache Solr Setup
===============================================================================
You have to have a java VM installed prior to installing Solr!
Download a 3.4 release of Apache Solr and extract it somewhere on your server:
http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/

- go to the "example" directory and create a directory named "openskos"
- copy the "data/solr/conf" directory of the OpenSKOS checkout to the 
  SOLR-INSTALL_DIR/example/openskos directory

You can now start Solr (in this example with 1.024Mb memory assigned):
java -Dsolr.solr.home="./openskos" -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -jar start.jar
